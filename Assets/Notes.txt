General Design Ideas
--------------------
* Almost entirely action focused, no puzzles like in later Konami Frogger
* Both hand-crafted and infini-procgen stages
* Less themeing of level obstacles/elements for design clarity
* Hand crafted levels can be both linear and exploratory
* Player must release input in order to hop, holding just preps them (like in Crossy Road). Allows for last minute hesitations
* Theme of nature vs technology. Animal versus the hazards of mechanization


Implementation Spec Notes
-------------------------
Layers: Solid, XZHopThrough, XYZHopThrough


Fundamental Gameplay Elements
-----------------------------
* Deadly Obstacles
    - Generated by pattern (cars)
    - Follow path
    - Move randomly
    - Off-grid trajectory (energy builets?)
    - Rotating
    - Lasers, static and moving
* Moving platforms
    - Generated by pattern (logs)
    - Follow path
    - Non-deadly or deadly underneath
    - Platforms that only move to location with player on them
* Deadly pits
    - Rising and lowering water/lava
* Deadly tiles
    - Electric/spike floor
    - Train
* Falling tiles
* Slippery floors
    - Ice
    - Oil
    - Slime
* Buttons
    - One time use, toggle, or timer
    - Turn on/off moving platforms
    - Open/close gates
    - Wall buttons that can only be pressed by tongue
* Bouncy pads
    - Play can control direction mid-air on landing
* Tongue hooks (cross two tiles)
    - Horizontal tongue hooks coming out of wall
* Power-up Bugs
    - Fireflys make player glow in dark
    - Crickets make player super hop three tiles
    - Horned beetles make player able to destroy certain obstacles they touch (invinciablity)
    - Spiders allow player to hop on side of certain walls
    - Water striders allow the player to hop on water
    - Fast bug (not decided yet) that makes player hop faster
* Collectables
    - Baby frogs (Required)
    - Flies (Optional)
* Conveyors
    - Act almost as stationary moving platforms
* Slopes
    - 45-60 degree slopes the player slides down
* Timed on/off platforms
* Expanding, flooding deadly obstacles
    - Briars?
* Q-Bert tiles
    - Need to flip all colors, when touched toggle
* Sticky floors
    - Cannot super hop off, move slightly slower? (might feel terrible)
* Short moving obstacles
    - Player can, and must, superhop over them
* Tiles that make player auto-hop (Pac-Man/Snake like movement)
* Tiles that make player hop 1 extra tile than normal for their movement
